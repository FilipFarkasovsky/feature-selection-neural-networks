# Feature Selection in Neural Networks

> This project aims to evaluate and compare Feature Selection algorithms. 

This repository extends the work of Barbieri et al. (2024), *“Analysis and Comparison of Feature Selection Methods Towards Performance and Stability”*, by incorporating **neural network–based models** and additional evaluation metrics. The goal is to analyze the **performance, stability, and computational efficiency** of various feature selection methods when applied to neural networks.
