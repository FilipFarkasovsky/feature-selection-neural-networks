# Feature Selection in Neural Networks

> This project aims to evaluate and compare Feature Selection algorithms. 

This repository extends the work of Barbieri et al. (2024), “Analysis and Comparison of Feature Selection Methods Towards Performance and Stability”, by incorporating neural network–based models and additional evaluation metrics. The aim is to analyze the performance, stability, and computational efficiency of various feature selection methods when applied to neural networks.
